Food delivery is something most of us can't leave without. The pandemic and safety regulations made applications like UberEats even more popular. Now, to taste their favorite meal, restaurant guests place an order and wait for a courier to deliver it.  Moreover, food orders are the only way for restaurants to earn money, while dine-ins are prohibited in numerous countries, including the U.S. Even though Uber Eats popularity, many restaurant owners criticize the platform for unfair service commissions that reduce restaurants' already small profit margin. For that reason, savoy restaurant owners are considering developing their food delivery marketplaces like UberEats. As the saying goes, if you can't beat them, lead them. Suppose you are one of the brave and optimistic food tech entrepreneurs and considering developing an app like Grubhub or UberEats.
